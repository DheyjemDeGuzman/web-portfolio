			<p class="about">
				Graduated as Computer Engineering and was a SAP Basis in accenture for almost 2 years. I aspire to be a Full stack developer and create a lot of functional and creative websites. Thus I decided to join the bootcamp in Tuitt to be able to learn the backend and frontend development of the websites and to land my dream job as a Web Developer.

				Personally, I love to travel. Love to hike and the ocean, it is so refreshing to be one with nature. Great escape from all the stress and noise of the city
